# PageFlipper
Someone asked me if it was possible to make a Java application flip like a page, so I researched and figured this out. I don't remember the article I read to get this to work. The code used may even be obsolete at this time, but I would like to get into this more and figure out what the modern solution this would be, whether it's incorporating another language entirely or not... So far it works with just Java.
